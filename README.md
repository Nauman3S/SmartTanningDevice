### Responses

Many API endpoints return the JSON representation of the resources created or edited. However, if an invalid request is submitted, or some other error occurs, Gophish returns a JSON response in the following format:

```javascript
{
  "status"  : int,
  "message" : string
}
```
The `message` attribute contains a message commonly used to indicate errors or to return the logged status/

The `status` attribute describes if the transaction was successful or not.


### Status Codes

IoTManagementSystem Backend returns the following status codes in its API:

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | `OK` |
| 201 | `CREATED` |
| 400 | `BAD REQUEST` |
| 404 | `NOT FOUND` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` |

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1.  Run installer script on your Raspberry Pi.
2.  Note down the MAC Address given by the installer script at the end.
3.  Add the device with the MAC Address collected in the previous step to the database using addDevice API endpoint mentioned above
4.  Interact with the device with using MAC Address, or interact with all the devices in the system by using `all` in devices parameter of the API.
